A snakefile pipeline for ATAC-Seq.

Change the config.yaml file appropriately according to your data. 
Update replicat1.tsv and replicate2.tsv for Replicate 1 and Replicate 2 respectively. 
Update parameters of Genrich in the config file. Also, change workdir where the samples exist, reference genome,  etc. 

Then run: snakemake -jnumber_of_cores, for example for 5 cores use:

    snakemake -j5 

and for a dry run use: 

    snakemake -j1 -n 


and to print the commands in a dry run use:

    snakemake -j1 -n -p 

For the sake reproducibility, use conda to pull same versions of tools. Snakemake and conda have to be installed in your system:

    snakemake --cores --use-conda
